## Step 2: Setup

In my RC Car I have two motors, front to control left/right and rear which controls forward/backward motion.
Starting with Raspberry Pi, the figure below shows the pinout digram of the Raspberry Pi where you will hook-up the wires from it to the motors through L293d. L293d contains two full H-bridges which enable us to control two DC motors bi-directionally. For the consistency when we go over the software setup, we will use these pins(40, 38, 36) for front motor and pins(37, 35, 33) for rear. Feel free to change them to whatever you prefere if you know what youâ€™re doing.

## Step 3: Manual Control Using RPi & Python

In order to let the car autonomously drive, we need it to control itself. So, we need first to figure out a way to control it using some keys and I chose keys(w,a,s,d) on the keyboard as they used in games, w: Forward, s: Straight, a: Left, d: Right. You can find the code for controlling the RC Car in my Github Repo.
Note: Please submit Pull Request if you have better implementation.
